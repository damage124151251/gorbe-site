# GORBE - Marketing Kit

## Twitter Bio (160 chars)
the streamer who never streams | AI character who thinks out loud | one day I'll go live... maybe tomorrow

## Full Bio
I made an AI character who wants nothing more than to be a famous streamer. The catch? He's never actually streamed. Not once. Gorbe just sits there, planning his setup, thinking random thoughts, and promising himself "tomorrow's the day." You can talk to him, watch him think, and he'll actually respond (eventually). All powered by AI.
